<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> This article is about the comics. For the 2011 film, see The Adventures of Tintin (film). For other uses, see The Adventures of Tintin (disambiguation). </p>
<p> The Adventures of Tintin (French: Les Aventures de Tintin; [lez‚Äøav…ëÃÉty Å d…ô t…õÃÉt…õÃÉ]) is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Herg√©. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Herg√©'s birth in 1907,[1] Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies,[2] and had been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film. </p>
<p> The series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in Le Petit Vingti√®me (The Little Twentieth), a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle (The Twentieth Century). The success of the series led to serialised strips published in Belgium's leading newspaper Le Soir (The Evening) and spun into a successful Tintin magazine. In 1950, Herg√© created Studios Herg√©, which produced the canonical versions of ten Tintin albums. Following Herg√©'s death in 1983, the final instalment of the series, Tintin and Alph-Art, was released posthumously. </p>
<p> The series is set during a largely realistic[3] 20th century. Its protagonist is Tintin, a courageous young Belgian reporter and adventurer aided by his faithful dog Snowy (Milou in the original French edition). Other allies include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock, the intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (French: Professeur Tournesol), incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (French: Dupont et Dupond), and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore. </p>
<p> The series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herg√©'s signature ligne claire ("clear line") style.[4] Its well-researched[5] plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of political or cultural commentary. </p> <br>
<h3> History </h3>
<h5>Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle: 1929‚Äì1939 </h5>
<p>Georges Prosper Remi, best known under the pen name Herg√©, was employed as an illustrator at Le Vingti√®me Si√®cle (The Twentieth Century), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Herg√©'s native Brussels. Run by the Abb√© Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a "Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information" and disseminated a fascist viewpoint.[7] Wallez appointed Herg√© editor of a new Thursday youth supplement, titled Le Petit Vingti√®me ("The Little Twentieth").[8] Propagating Wallez's sociopolitical views to its young readership, it contained explicitly pro-fascist and antisemitic sentiment.[9] In addition to editing the supplement, Herg√© illustrated L'extraordinaire aventure de Flup, N√©nesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, N√©nesse, Poussette and Cochonnet),[10] a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper's sport staff. Dissatisfied with this, Herg√© wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip.[11] </p>
<p>He already had experience creating comic strips. From July 1926, he had written a strip about a Boy Scout patrol leader titled Les Aventures de Totor C.P. des Hannetons (The Adventures of Totor, Scout Leader of the Cockchafers) for the Scouting newspaper Le Boy Scout Belge (The Belgian Boy Scout).[11] Totor was a strong influence on Tintin,[12] with Herg√© describing the latter as being like Totor's younger brother.[6] Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically, Totor and Tintin were "virtually identical" except for the Scout uniform,[13] also noting many similarities between their respective adventures, particularly in the illustration style, the fast pace of the story, and the use of humour.[14] He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium such as the systematic use of speech bubbles‚Äîfound in such American comics as George McManus' Bringing up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat, and Rudolph Dirks's Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter L√©on Degrelle.[15] </p>
<p> Although Herg√© wanted to send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as antisocialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was serialised in Le Petit Vingti√®me from January 1929 to May 1930.[17] Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Paris Gare du Nord railway station, following which he organised the publication of the story in book form.[18] The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Herg√© two assistants.[19] At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, but at the time was uncontroversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.[20]</p>
<p>For the third adventure, Tintin in America, serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Herg√© finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, and used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultraconservative ideology.[21] The Adventures of Tintin had been syndicated to a Catholic magazine named C≈ìurs Vaillants (Brave Hearts) since 1930, and Herg√© was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers, too.[22]

    Herg√© wrote a string of Adventures of Tintin, sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, United States, Egypt, India, Tibet, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state of Borduria‚Äîwhose leader's name, M√ºsstler, was a portmanteau of the names of the Nazi German F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler and the Italian Fascist Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.[23] </p> <br>
<h5>Le Soir: 1940‚Äì1945 </h5>
<p>In September 1944, the Allies entered Brussels and Herg√©'s German employers fled. Le Soir was shut down and The Adventures of Tintin was put on hold.[29] Then in 1946, Herg√© accepted an invitation from Belgian comic publisher Raymond Leblanc and his new publishing company Le Lombard to continue The Adventures of Tintin in the new Le journal de Tintin (Tintin magazine).[30] Herg√© quickly learned that he no longer had the independence he preferred; he was required to produce two coloured pages a week for Leblanc's magazine, a tall order.[31]

    In 1950, Herg√© began to poach the better members of the Tintin magazine staff to work in the large house on Avenue Louise that contained the fledgling Studios Herg√©.[32] Bob De Moor (who imitated Herg√©'s style and did half the work),[32] Guy Dessicy (colourist), and Marcel DeHaye (secretary) were the nucleus. To this, Herg√© added Jacques Martin (imitated Herg√©'s style), Roger Leloup (detailed, realistic drawings), Eug√®ne Evany (later chief of the Studios),[30] Michel Demaret (letterer), and Baudouin Van Den Branden (secretary).[33] As Harry Thompson observed, the idea was to turn the process of creating The Adventures of Tintin into a "veritable production line, the artwork passing from person to person, everyone knowing their part, like an artistic orchestra with Herg√© conducting".[34] The studios produced eight new Tintin albums for Tintin magazine, and coloured and reformatted two old Tintin albums. Studios Herg√© continued to release additional publications until Herg√©'s death in 1983. In 1986, a 24th unfinished album was released, the studios were disbanded, and the assets were transferred to the Herg√© Foundation.[35] </p>
